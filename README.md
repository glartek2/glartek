**`Computer Science Student`**

Hello! My name is Sebastian, and I am a computer science student. I have a passion for writing programs that solve real-life problems. I particularly enjoy working on algorithms and integrating them into programs. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills in coding and problem-solving as well as training my soft skills.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    My journey into coding began in middle school when I initially joined a computer science class for its Photoshop course. However, I quickly became captivated by coding after our teacher posed algorithm questions to students from other courses. I love a good puzzle, and this sparked my interest in programming.
    For a couple of years, I delved deeply into problem-solving and math, almost completely pausing my coding activities. When the time came to choose a career path, I realized that creating and integrating real-life solutions was more exciting to me than theoretical calculations. Now, after two years of college, I am pursuing my Computer Science degree with a focus on algorithms.

 <summary><h3> üïπÔ∏è My Relax time </h3></summary>
    I am huge fan of souls games, in fact Sekiro is my favourite game, they really teach one patience and determination to overcome obstacles. Other than that I also like to play games like Minecraft when I can let off my creativty or just relax and be immersed by good story. The last reason is also same that I like good book or movie. Gaming is also a way to spend time with my long distance pals.

    Also like most people I like listen to music, soundtracks from games I played/movies I watched especially. It also helps me focus during working.
    
    The other thing I like is gastronomy, as I alone do not cook as often, I like to watch and read about techniques and products from other countries and learing about they eating/cooking culture. One of my wish is to travel all countries I learned about and try they local food there (and do some sightseeing)
